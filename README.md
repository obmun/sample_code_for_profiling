Sample source code for performance analysis
===========================================

The simple code in this repo is part of an article about profiling in Linux (and some other stuff) posted to my
irrelevant [blog](http://www.jcc.solosade.com).

It does nothing more than wasting a few CPU cycles, with the functions split out into a shared library. The code
is as well an example of a few modern/C++11 techniques. Build system is [CMake](https://www.cmake.org).
